Description: lightweight command line video extraction tool 
 cclive is a lightweight command line video extraction tool for Youtube and
 other similar video websites. It is a rewrite of the clive software in C++
 with lower system footprint and fewer dependencies.
 .
 cclive is primarily a "video download tool" but it can also be used along
 side with video player software, like "mplayer", for viewing streamed
 videos instead of the Adobe flash player.
